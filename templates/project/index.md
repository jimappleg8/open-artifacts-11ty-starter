{% pageHeader "About This Project", "Every Open Artifacts project starts somewhere. Use this page to talk about what you're trying to do or present what you've already done." %}

This is a placeholder page for you to use to start your project pages.

Project pages are here to contain whatever you need to communicate about your open artifact. It can be instructions or explanations. Essentially, you're trying to provide everything someone else would need to reproduce your artifact, whether it be a printable game or schematics for a house.
