- title: "The Foundation"
  status: "In Progress"
  vision: >
    We need to establish the core infrastructure. The goal is to make it easy for 
    anyone to clone the starter and get running in under 5 minutes.
  tasks:
    - "Add Netlify documentation."
    - "Complete the GitHub repository README."
    - "Set up GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments."
    - "Complete the Using the Starter instructions page."
    - "Add documentation about generating favicons and site icons."
    - "Add better documentation about available shortcodes and macros."
    - "Add a site.xml file for SEO. This is pretty simple using 11ty collections."

    The next step is to ensure the site is fully responsive and works well on 
    mobile devices. This includes optimizing layouts, navigation, and performance.
  tasks:
    - "Optimize images and assets for faster load times on mobile networks."

- title: "Nice-to-haves and Enhancements"
  status: "Planned"
  vision: >
    As I've built the starter, I've thought of new features that would enhance the
    user experience. These are not critical for launch but would be great to have.
  tasks:
    - "Add a 'copy code' button to code blocks."
    - "Build a script that will auto-generate a theme file based on user colors."
    - "Install the markdown-it-anchor plugin to automatically add anchor links to headings in the content."

- title: "Using Obsidian as a CMS"
  status: "Planned"
  vision: >
    Many users will want to use Obsidian to manage their artifact content. We 
    need to ensure compatibility and provide clear instructions.
  tasks:
    - "Document the process of setting up Obsidian with the starter."
    - "Explain how Obsidian can work with Sync to manage content across devices."
    - "Figure out a workflow for images and other assets when using Obsidian."
