- title: "The Foundation"
  status: "In Progress"
  vision: |
    We need to establish the core infrastructure. The goal is to make it easy for 
    anyone to clone the starter and get running in under 5 minutes.
  tasks:
    - "Refactor the way config files are organized. E.g. split out sections of the site.js config into separate files."
    - "Create the JSON generation pipeline."
    - "Add Netlify config files and documentation."
    - "Add a site.xml file for SEO. This is pretty simple using 11ty collections."

- title: "The Mobile-First Experience"
  status: "In Progress"
  vision: |
    The next step is to ensure the site is fully responsive and works well on 
    mobile devices. This includes optimizing layouts, navigation, and performance.
  tasks:
    - "Optimize images and assets for faster load times on mobile networks."
    - "Test across various devices and screen sizes."

- title: "Nice-to-haves and Enhancements"
  status: "Planned"
  vision: |
    As I've built the starter, I've thought of new features that would enhance the
    user experience. These are not critical for launch but would be great to have.
  tasks:
    - "Add a 'copy code' button to code blocks."
    - "Build a script that will auto-generate a theme file based on user colors."

- title: "Using Obsidian as a CMS"
  status: "Planned"
  vision: |
    Many users will want to use Obsidian to manage their artifact content. We 
    need to ensure compatibility and provide clear instructions.
  tasks:
    - "Document the process of setting up Obsidian with the starter."
    - "Create templates and guidelines for writing artifact markdown files in Obsidian."
    - "Consider whether some data files (like this one) could be written in Markdown."
    - "Explain how Obsidian can work with Sync to manage content across devices."
    - "On phones, perhaps recommend a code editor for editing non-markdown files."
    - "Figure out a workflow for images and other assets when using Obsidian."

- title: "The OA Network"
  status: "Planned"
  vision: |
    Once the single-site experience is solid, we need to connect it to the 
    Open Artifacts Hub. This involves finalizing the schema.
  tasks:
    - "Draft the JSON schema for Open Artifacts."
    - "Build the search indexer."
