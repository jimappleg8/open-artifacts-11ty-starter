# Features Overview

The main features of this website starter are centered around the specific needs of an Open Artifacts website.

## Simple Static Website

This site is powered by Eleventy (11ty). No database, no fuss. Just edit Markdown files and publish.

## Code is managed on Github

Github offers free accounts for users creating public repositories like this one. It also has built-in tools that make it easier for others to contact you, make suggestions and otherwise contribute to your project.

## Designed for Netlify or Github Pages

Netlify is a great hosting service for static sites like this one. It also has a free tier, so getting up and running is simple. Github has hosting too, and you can host on that service as well for free.

## Themes

There are some preset themes (mostly color schemes) that you can choose from. Applying them is as easy as changing a setting in a file.

## Dark/Light Mode

The site has a button that will switch between Light and Dark modes across your site.

## "Link in Bio" Page

It's common to have an Instagram or Tik Tok account associated with an open artifact, and this page allows you to put a link in your bio without having to set up something extra at a site like Linktree.

## "Components" as Nunjucks Macros and Shortcodes

We use macros and shortcodes to add interest without mixing HTML with Markdown.

## Use Obsidian as a Content Management System (CMS)

Obsidian is an awesome and free application that helps you create a personal knowledge base using Markdown files just like what Eleventy uses. You can point Obsidian at your working files on your computer and create content in a very nice interface.
