Strictly speaking, you don't need to have a website to have an Open Artifacts project. There are many ways to set up the kind collaborative space that you need. But modern websites are probably the best medium we have come up with for presenting information. They can contain text, images, video and just about anything else you would want to show about your project. The website is not the project itself, but it can be an important communication tool and access point for your project.

I'm creating this starter template because I want to make it as simple as possible for people to create an Open Artifacts website. It includes a number of features that are specific to Open Artifacts projects:

- It's simple to customize colors.
- You can use Markdown syntax to create new content.
- It integrates Tailwinds CSS so you can get fancier with your page formatting if you want.

An open artifacts project should meet three requirements:
- The project materials should be available so that others can contribute.
- It links to the Creative Commons BY 4.0 (Attribution) license by default.
